# Welcome to PolyQuilt

## What is PolyQuilt?

PolyQuilt is an add-on for Blender 2.8 that supports low-poly modeling. In addition to the simple, orthodox, and old-school faceting functions, it supports polygon modeling by assigning various functions to mouse operations such as clicking, dragging, and holding to minimize tool switching.
It also works well with tablets and tablet PCs with digitizers, allowing you to model intuitively while reducing the amount of interaction.

I am happy that you will create an attractive low-poly model with this add-on!
