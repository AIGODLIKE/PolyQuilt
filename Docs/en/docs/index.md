# Welcome to PolyQuilt

## What is PolyQuilt?

PolyQuilt is an add-on for Blender 2.8 that supports low-poly modeling.  
In addition to simple modeling capabilities, it supports fast and intuitive polygon modeling with minimal interaction by assigning various functions to mouse actions such as clicking, dragging and holding.
It also works well with tablets and tablet PCs with digitizers.

I hope this add-on will make your modeling life happy!
